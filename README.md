# Introduction 
### Exploratory Data Analysis on Electricity/Internship assessment for stage-one 

I aimed to explore fuel utility data to understand
the maps and patterns using statistical approach on
how electricity are generally distributed,factors that
could bring about an overall increase in electricity bills,
and then went ahead to investigate the trend in the total 
amount of energy generated in different years, how each of the 
year has a possibility of being hit by a global warming or not. 

Also investigated how each type of quantity of fuel can 
affect the cost of burning fuels and electricity bills 

#### Summarized the analysis by answering important questions infered from my analysis 

     1. Which year recorded the highest energy generated ?

     2. Which fuel unit has the highest burning cost?

     3. What fuel type was used the most. And why? 
     
     4. Which year has the highest fuel cost delivered.And Why? 
     
     5. Which fuel type has the highest cost of fuel burned. And why?
